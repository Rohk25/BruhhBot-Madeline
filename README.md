# [BruhhBot-Madeline](https://telegram.me/BruhhBotV2)

BruhhBotV2.0 is a supergroup manager bot, based on [Daniil's](https://github.com/danog/MadelineProto) MadelineProto implementation for the Telegram Bot API

## Getting Started

To begin using BruhhBot, you will first need to have PHP 7 installed, and set as the default (see below). You will also need php7.0-xml and php7.0-mbstring.

You will also need to register your account and retrieve your Telegram MTProto API and ID [here](https://my.telegram.org/apps)

Install php and it's required extensions

```
sudo apt-get install -y composer php7.0 php7.0-common php7.0-mbstring php7.0-xml php7.0-bcmath php7.0-mcrypt php7.0-curl
```
### Installing

To deploy BruhhBot, let's clone it to the computer we want to use it on

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/hbashton/BruhhBot-Madeline.git -b bot-api
```

Create a .env file using [the one provided](.env.example) as a template

Grab your Weather API key using [DarkSky](https://darksky.net/dev/) and place in the .env file

Obtain an API key from [@BotFather](http://telegram.me/botfather)

If you want to make your bot a little different than BruhhBot, or just want to play with the responses, you can make a file called custom_responses.json and place it in the root of the source, copying all the contents from [responses.json](responses.json) and modifying them as you see fit.

Finally, deploy your bot

```
./init.sh
```
## FAQ
